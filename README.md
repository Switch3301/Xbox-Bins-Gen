# Xbox-Bins-Gen
Automate Xbox Purchase  via python. 

# Info

Automate Xbox purchases using Python with the help of the code available at https://github.com/notlit69/xbox-bins-gen. To use the code, start by adding proxies to the proxies.txt file. Find the locale of the desired game pass location by locating the gamepass URL. For instance, to use a UAE bin, search for Xbox Game Pass Arab Emirates and locate the URL, which should look like this: https://www.xbox.com/ar-AE/xbox-game-pass. Here, the locale is "ar-AE". The format for the bins.txt file is given as an example within the file.

Add your email addresses in the format "email|password" to the accs.txt file. You can configure the skuid and product id in the config.json file, where you can choose between the PC Game Pass (CFQ7TTC0KGQ8: 0002), Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (CFQ7TTC0KHS0: 0007), and Minecraft (9NXP44L49SHJ: 0010).
